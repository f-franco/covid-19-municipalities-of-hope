By summer 2020, the federal government in Mexico presented a program that would lead the re-opening of the economy, *"municipios de la esperanza"* (municipalities of hope). This notebook shows the execution process of building a visualization with which better evaluate the extent of this program in Mexico. There are two main parts to this process, data transformation and cartogram plotting.

## Data Transformation

It was necessary to build a table that contained the names of all municipalities in Mexico, along with its population and whether they were part of the program or not.

## Cartogram Plotting

To properly plot the data in a way that was useful to appreciate the impact of the program, certain parameters were changed with respect to the scaling of the polygons and their color.

## Result
